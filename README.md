This is a school assignment repository
I chose the repository I created online and cloned it to a newly created folder on my computer. Edited in my notepad and went back to GitHub.

#About Me
##My Interests
Some of my main iterests are gaming on colsole and PC. Creating visual art with acrylic, oil, and watercolor paint. I also enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and exploring new areas of nature. 
##Websites I Recommend
  - [Amazon] (htttp://amazon.com)- I recommend Amazon because it has fast shipping and really good prices on things you cant always find in the store. Amazon also provides a great space to sell items and create another stream of income or express your own creativity by creating and selling items you have created personally.
  - [YouTube] (http://youtube.com)- YouTube is an awesome video streaming application and website that allows users to access a wide variety of videos for both learning and entertainment. You can literally find anything on YouTube from step by step help videos all the way to funny dog videos. There is also an option to start your own channel and stream things you are passionate about which creates an oppurtunity to build substantial income and interact with subscribers.
